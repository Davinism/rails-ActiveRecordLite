# ActiveRecordLite

## Objective

The purpose behind this project was to implement a simple version of Rails' ActiveRecord that allows the users to interact with the application database. Through this project, a greater understanding of how ActiveRecord works was achieved. Features such as attr_accessors, database queries, and associations were all implemented. Furthermore, this project provided a great opportunity to practice meta-programming concepts in Ruby.
